title: Diabetic Retinopathy
description: Our work explored development of diabetic retinopathy screening tool, a software framework that efficiently captures online diagnoses, stores retinal images for eye specialist reference, and assesses retinopathy patients to gather their preferred referral modality. The system has been implemented in the Milwaukee community to successfully offer eye screenings to more than 1300 patients, primarily among African American or Latino populations.
