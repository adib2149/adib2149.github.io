title: Veteran Crisis Management
description: This work aids in crisis management in PTSD-affected veterans via peer-mentor relationship using mHealth tools. Veterans are exposed to trauma in war zones which affect most of them with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or other mental health problems to some degree. As part of a bigger study, in this research work, we have collected accelerometer data from subjects performing few gestures and detect them using machine learning techniques.
