title: Family Self-management Intervention
description: Solid organ transplant is the treatment of choice for children with end-stage organ failure. Ongoing recovery and medical management at home after transplant is important for recovery and transition to daily life. Smartphones are widely used and hold the potential for aiding in the establishment of mHealth protocols. In this research, we (Health care providers, nurses, and computer scientists) collaboratively designed and developed myFAMI, a smartphone-based intervention application to promote a family self-management intervention for pediatric transplant families. The myFAMI application framework is built upon a theory-based intervention for pediatric transplant patients, with aid from action research methodology.
