title: Causal Inference
description: My dissertation work revolves around use of Causal Inference, specifically Structural Theory of Causation, in effective use of causal exploration for healthcare datasets. Few of my theoretical worksCKH&#58; hazard ratio estimation in observational studies through backdoor adjustment on structural causal models, causal knowledge hierarchy for merging of knowledge from various sources such as data, published literature, experts' opinion, expression of pragmatic clinical trials through structural causal models. Additionally, from an application viewpoint, we are leveraging these methods in finding drug-effects and causal connections of delirium patients in the ICU, using large electronic healthcare datasets.
