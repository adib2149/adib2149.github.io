I am currently an Informatics Postdoctoral Researcher at [Oregon Clinical & Translational Research Institute (OCTRI)](https://www.ohsu.edu/octri) in [Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU)](https://www.ohsu.edu), Portland, Oregon, U.S.A. I am also a Marquette alumnus, an ex-BUETian, and an ex-cadet.

I have 5+ years of research experience in Machine Learning & Data Science for healthcare; as well as software development & engineering. I have had 15+ publications and service as reviewer in 10+ conferences and journals in the Healthcare and Machine Learning domain. Currently, I am actively working in the field of `Causal Inference`; my primary focus is to apply Causal Inference and related theories in exploring cause-and-effect relationships in experimental and observational datasets.

My research goals aim to achieve `data-driven causal explorations`, mostly for `Electronic Healthcare Data` My primary tools are `Structural Causal Models`, `Propensity Score Matching`, `A/B Testing` and a little bit of `Do-Why`.  

Outside research activities, I destress mostly by singing. My other hobbies include playing guitar, reading thriller books, playing board games, PS5 games & basketball, and some more.
