I am currently an Informatics Postdoctoral Researcher at [Oregon Clinical and Translational Research Institute (OCTRI)](https://www.ohsu.edu/octri), [Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU)](https://www.ohsu.edu). I have completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Marquette University, and my undergrad (B.Sc.) in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from Bangladesh University of Engineering adn Technology (BUET). 

My vision is to apply data driven causal exploration to improvement of healhcare researhc and health informatics. AI in Healthcare is a happening thing, and . I am actively working in the field of Causal Inference. My primary focus is to apply `Causal Inference` and related theories in exploring cause-and-effect relationships in experimental and observational datasets. 

Apart from the research works, I enjoy my free time mostly by singing. My other hobbies include reading thriller books, playing guitar, experimenting with electronics and electronic gadgets, playing board games, playing basketball, gaming on my PS5, and some more.

I was introduced to the world of `Causal Inference` <i>(by Dr. Adibuzzaman)</i> in 2018. I was immediately hooked to the fascinating works of Pearl, Elias, Rubin, Hernan, and many other researchers working relentlessly in this field. It has been a rabbit hole from there, and the more I learn, the more I find there is left to answer. I firmly believe Causal Inference is going to be one of the strongest pillars of data science in the next decades, and that is why I have decided to pursue this and make it my Ph.D. dissertation work. 

During my Ph.D., I have worked closely under the supervision of my Ph.D. Supervisor, [Dr. Sheikh Iqbal Ahamed](http://www.mscs.mu.edu/~iq/), and with direct guidance from [Dr. Mohammad Adibuzzaman](https://adibzaman.github.io/), In the past, I have worked on multiple projects involving `mobile health and computing`, `ubiquitous computing`, `crisis management`, etc. Hereâ€™s a [list](https://adib2149.github.io/research) of all the research projects I have worked on.
