I am soon starting a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship with [OCTRI](https://www.ohsu.edu/octri) at the [Oregon Health & Science University](https://www.ohsu.edu). I have completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Marquette University, and have previously worked as a Graduate Assistant at the Ubicomp Lab. 

Working under the supervision of my Ph.D. Supervisor, [Dr. Sheikh Iqbal Ahamed](http://www.mscs.mu.edu/~iq/), and with direct guidance from [Dr. Mohammad Adibuzzaman](https://adibzaman.github.io/), I am actively working in the field of Causal Inference. My primary focus is to apply `Causal Inference` and related theories in exploring cause-and-effect relationships in experimental and observational datasets. In the past, I have worked on multiple projects involving `mobile health and computing`, `ubiquitous computing`, `crisis management`, etc. Hereâ€™s a [list](https://adib2149.github.io/research) of all the research projects I have worked on.

Apart from the research works, when I am not down at the lab, I enjoy my free time mostly by singing. My other hobbies include reading thriller books, playing guitar, experimenting with electronics and electronic gadgets, playing board games, playing basketball, gaming on my PS5, and some more.
